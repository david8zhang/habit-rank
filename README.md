# Habit-Rank

Just a small project to see what's new with Next.JS and try out Tailwind CSS. Habit-Rank is a gamified habit-tracking app which uses a rank based progression system you might see in competitive online multiplayer games (e.g. Valorant, LoL)

Completing a habit grants Rank EXP. Failing to complete deducts Rank EXP. Pretty simple
